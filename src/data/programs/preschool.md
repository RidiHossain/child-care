    ## Our preschool program approach
            
    Our preschool program prepares children for kindergarten through play-based learning experiences. We focus on developing the whole child - socially, emotionally, cognitively, and physically.
        
    ### What your preschooler will learn
            
    - Early literacy skills through stories, songs, and conversations
    - Early numeracy concepts through play and exploration
    - Social skills through group activities and cooperative play
    - Emotional regulation and self-help skills
    - Creative expression through art, music, and dramatic play
    - Physical development through active play and movement

    Our caregivers create a rich learning environment that supports each child's natural curiosity and love of learning.
