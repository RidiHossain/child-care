    ## Our infant care approach
            
    We provide nurturing, individualized care for babies from 6 weeks to 18 months. Our caregivers are specially trained in infant development and maintain detailed daily reports about your baby's feeding, sleeping, and activities.
        
    ### What we provide
            
    - Individualized feeding and sleeping schedules
    - Developmentally appropriate activities and stimulation
    - Regular communication about your baby's day
    - Safe sleep practices and monitoring
    - Gentle, responsive care that builds trust
    - Age-appropriate toys and materials

    We believe every baby is unique and develops at their own pace. Our caregivers observe and support each infant's individual developmental journey while providing a safe, loving environment.
