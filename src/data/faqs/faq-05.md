question: Do you welcome parent involvement? Can I stop by unannounced?
answer: Absolutely! We encourage parent involvement and welcome visits. You can stop by anytime during operating hours to check on your child. We also have regular parent-teacher conferences, family events, and daily communication about your child's activities and development.
