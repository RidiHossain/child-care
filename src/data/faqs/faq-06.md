question: What is your child-to-caregiver ratio?
answer: We maintain small group sizes to ensure individual attention. Infants (0-12 months) have a 4-1 ratio, Toddlers (12-36 months) have a 6-1 ratio, Preschoolers (3-5 years) have an 8-1 ratio, and School-age (6-12 years) have a 12-1 ratio. These ratios allow us to provide personalized care and attention to each child.
