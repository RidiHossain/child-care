question: What is your sick child policy?
answer: We ask that children stay home if they have a fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or other contagious conditions. This helps protect the health of all children and staff. Children should be symptom-free for 24 hours before returning. We will contact parents immediately if a child becomes ill while in our care.
